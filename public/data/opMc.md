Got it—let’s drop the table and go for a cleaner, high-energy list that’s perfect for a blog post or a "Frost Anime" recommendation page.

Here are the 10 best "Blazing" Action Anime with Overpowered MCs:

1. Solo Leveling
The ultimate "zero to hero" story. Sung Jinwoo starts as the world's weakest hunter but gains a unique leveling system that turns him into a god-like Shadow Monarch.

The "Blaze": Watching him walk into a room and say "Arise," turning his dead enemies into his personal shadow army.

Platform: Crunchyroll

2. One Punch Man
The gold standard for OP MCs. Saitama is so powerful that the entire show is a comedy about his struggle to find a worthy opponent.

The "Blaze": The "Serious Punch." When Saitama actually puts in 1% effort, the animation budget and the landscape both explode.

Platform: Netflix, Hulu, Crunchyroll

3. The Misfit of Demon King Academy
Anos Voldigoad is the king of "disrespect." He’s so overpowered that he can kill an enemy with the sound of his own heartbeat or resurrect them just to kill them again.

The "Blaze": He literally pulls a sword out of his own shadow that can cut through the laws of reality.

Platform: Crunchyroll

4. Mob Psycho 100
Shigeo (Mob) tries to suppress his psychic powers to live a normal life. But when his "stress meter" hits 100%, he becomes a force of nature that levels entire city blocks.

The "Blaze": The ???% mode. It’s raw, emotional destruction with some of the best hand-drawn animation in history.

Platform: Crunchyroll, Netflix

5. Jujutsu Kaisen (Focus on Gojo)
While the show has several leads, Satoru Gojo is the "Blazing" icon here. He is literally untouchable because of an infinite void that surrounds his body.

The "Blaze": "Hollow Purple." It’s a literal erasure of matter that looks like a beautiful, terrifying orb of destruction.

Platform: Crunchyroll, Netflix

6. That Time I Got Reincarnated as a Slime
Rimuru starts as a lowly slime but quickly becomes a "Demon Lord" capable of devouring entire armies to gain their skills.

The "Blaze": The "Megiddo" scene. Rimuru uses water droplets and sunlight to snip through thousands of soldiers in seconds without breaking a sweat.

Platform: Crunchyroll

7. Black Clover
Asta has no magic in a world where magic is everything. However, his "Anti-Magic" swords make him the ultimate counter to every "overpowered" villain in the series.

The "Blaze": His "Black Asta" transformation, where he grows a wing of pure dark energy and cuts through spells like they’re paper.

Platform: Crunchyroll, Netflix

8. Hell’s Paradise
Gabimaru the Hollow is a ninja who cannot be executed. No matter what the authorities try—fire, decapitation, or boiling oil—his body simply refuses to die.

The "Blaze": Using his "Ascetic Blaze" Ninjutsu to turn his body into a living furnace to incinerate supernatural monsters.

Platform: Crunchyroll

9. Overlord
Ainz Ooal Gown is a max-level player trapped in a world of low-level NPCs. He isn't just a hero; he's a conqueror who treats every battle like a calculated chess match.

The "Blaze": Using "Super-Tier Magic" to sacrifice 70,000 soldiers in one go, just to summon giant eldritch goats to finish the job.

Platform: Crunchyroll

10. Bleach: Thousand-Year Blood War
Ichigo Kurosaki’s return features top-tier modern animation. He is the ultimate hybrid of every power system in the show (Shinigami, Quincy, and Hollow).

The "Blaze": The reveal of his "True Zangetsu" and his "Horn of Salvation" form, which looks as lethal as it is cool.

Platform: Disney+, Hulu

❄️ The Bonus "Frost" Pick: The Irregular at Magic High School
Since you like that clean, "frosted" aesthetic, Tatsuya Shiba is your man. He is a high-tech mage who suppresses his emotions to act as a living tactical nuke. His magic often looks like digital blue "data" and involves molecular freezing—perfectly matching a "Frost" theme.

Platform: Crunchyroll, Hulu
